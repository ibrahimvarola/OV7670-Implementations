# OV7670 CMOS Camera Implementations using VHDL
These implementations were created in my way of learning the VHDL language. 
Some of these projects are directly translated from = http://www.dejazzer.com/eigenpi/digital_camera/digital_camera.html

### Thanks to:
- Dr. Cristinel Ababei from Marquette University for creating example implementations.
- Mike Field for his experimentations on this camera module.
